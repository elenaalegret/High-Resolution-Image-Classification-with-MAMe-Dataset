# High-Resolution Image Classification with MAMe Dataset
---

This project focused on image classification, using the MAMe dataset - a collection distinguished by its high resolution and variable shape attributes, comprising thousands of artworks from three museums-. 

The classification task involved differentiating between 29 artistic mediums. Through experiments, we evaluated the impact of high resolution images, variable shape inputs, and their combination. Results demonstrated enhanced performance with high resolution images and variable shapes.
